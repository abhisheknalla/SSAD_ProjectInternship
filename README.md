# SSAD_ProjectInternship

Monsoon 2017
Project with MLIT solutions on Consight.
Consight is an Industrial IoT application for remote condition monitoring of machinery,
detecting anomolies and developing prediction based analytics for production efficiency.

I as a part of a team of 3 worked with big database sets gathered from IoT devices using sensors.
My job was to extract information from these unorganised datasets using SQL and then organising it
using Python. I also had to visualize the data using graphs like bar graph, line graph and pie charts.
We also had to deploy the reports prepared on an Nginx web server.
